NOTICE:

* This file contains diverse evaluation metrics for salient object detection.

* Specifically, we include two versions of implementation, one is implemented and origanized by us, the other is implemented by Huaizu Jiang et al., i.e. the file "EvaluateMetrics_HuaizuJiang.m". Since their implementation of AUC score is a little different from ours, so the evaluation results are not consistent in AUC evaluation.

* If you use these files, please cite our paper and Huaizu's paper.
